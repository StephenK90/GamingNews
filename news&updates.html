          <h3>CoD's Season 3 update broke the game for a bunch of players, and they're so upset one sent the devs a pizza</h3></a>
          <p>
            On April 12, Call of Duty received its biggest multiplayer update since the release of Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 with the launch of Season 3.The new season added a pile of new maps, guns, modes, and features—as well as adding one fairly significant bug.

          <h3>This Lenovo gaming PC with an RTX 3080 is $770 off right now</h3></a>
          <p>
            The best gaming PC deals still dont come cheap, but they give you the chance at significant savings when you buy a powerful gaming desktop. Heres a good example — the seventh-generation Lenovo Legion Tower 7i with a $770 discount from Lenovo, which pulls its price down to $2,080 from its original price of $2,850. There are limited stocks of the machine though, so if you want to take advantage of this bargain, youll need to complete the purchase right away.

          <h3>Diablo 2 Resurrected season 4 makes huge impact with one small change</h3></a>
          <p>
            A first look at the Diablo 2 Resurrected season 4 patch notes reveals a seemingly small change that could dramatically affect your builds in the classic RPG game. What reads on paper as a simple quality-of-life change in Diablo 2 Resurrected patch 2.7 promises to be a huge buff to Mosaic Assassins and might have far-reaching ramifications on multiple builds as well as multiplayer in general.

          <h3>Hardspace: Shipbreaker How It Evolved From Game Jam Experiment, to Game Pass Gem, to New Game Series</h3></a>
          <p>
            Hardspace: Shipbreaker is that very rare thing: a video game that feels almost wholly unique. It may have the visual trappings of a first-person shooter  a HUD, a radial menu stuffed with equipment, a health bar  but simply playing the tutorial shows you how truly different this game is. After putting dozens of hours into the Shipbreaker salvaging yard, I became convinced that this is one of the most intriguing, beguiling, relaxing and testing experiences available in Xbox Game Pass.</p>

          <h3>Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon Combines FromSoftwares Souls Experience with the Franchises Mech History</h3></a>
          <p>
            Since its surprise announcement during The Game Awards this past December, weve been eager to learn more about FromSoftwares upcoming Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon, the first new Armored Core game in nearly a decade. Since the last entry in the franchise was released, the studios reputation for delivering high-quality and challenging games has only blossomed thanks to a string of commercial and critical hits like Dark Souls II & III, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and last years Elden Ring.

          <h3>How Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Breaks the Metroidvania Mold</h3></a>
          <p>
            As soon as you step back into Cal Kestis dusty boots in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, its clear that youre returning to play as a formidable character who isnt messing around. Cal hasnt woken up in a strange place unable to use his abilities for some reason, hes had time and space to hone them, and hes got things to do. In the history of Metroidvania games  games built around a steady acquisition of abilities that help you discover more of the world, this is not how things usually go. Most of these games (including the previous Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order) have you begin weak and become strong. Jedi: Survivor is very conscious about trying something new, and its a very welcome change to the formula.</p>

          <h3>Feel The Force with PS5s haptics and adaptive triggers in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</h3></a>
          <p>
            With the PlayStation 5 DualSense wireless controller, Respawn Entertainment  and Lucasfilm Games have been able to create one of the most immersive Star Wars gaming experiences yet. During your journey through the galaxy, youll be able to feel the power of the Force at your fingertips  quite literally.

            Using The Force
            Need that shiny object just out of reach? Bring it a bit closer with the tap of a trigger. If you find Cal surrounded by foes, why not pull them even closer to deal damage to all of them at once  or push them away with a blast of power from Cals hand.
            
            Youll truly be able to feel that power based on how youre using the Force, with trigger resistance influenced by how heavy or resistant enemies are youre trying to pull. After youve finally managed to pull the foe into attacking range or yank their shield away from them, the resistance will disappear to simulate a sense of victorious relief.

          <h3>Producer Takashi Tokita reveals the secrets of Live A Live</h3></a>
          <p>Hello PlayStation players! My name is Takashi Tokita, producer of Live A Live.
            Im excited to say that the game is now available to buy digitally for PS5 and PS4. Its a very unique RPG that lets you play through short stories across eight different time periods  all presented with beautiful HD-2D visuals.
            This game is very special to me  I directed the original Live A Live 29 years ago, and it was the first game I ever planned from the ground up. Its my most beloved title!
            To celebrate its release on PlayStation consoles, I wanted to share some memories of working on the game  both the original and the remake.
