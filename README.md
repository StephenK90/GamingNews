# Gamers United

An interactive gaming news website created as part of a school assignment.

The goal of my website is to create a community for gamers by providing a platform for them to connect, share information, and engage in discussions about their favorite games and gaming experiences. Additionally, my site aims to provide reliable and unbiased reviews of new games, updates, and releases. This is the first website I have ever built from scratch, and while it lacks the finesse and functionality of websites like IGN or Steam, I am quite proud of it. Please feel free to critique, as I am aware it is rather rough. If I went through with establishing this site, I would make the discussion section more streamlined. I would also change the review page so it has a comment section, and each individual game would have its own page with a full description, rating action, videos, photos, etc.
